## Instructions
As a developer at Jadu, you will be expected to be able to implement features that combine 2D and 3D elements when provided with rigid specifications. This task was designed to give us a sense of your comfortability in both of these spaces.

1. Clone the repository and make a branch off latest main
2. Complete the assignment so that the Customizer scene meets all technical requirements listed in the [design specifications](https://www.figma.com/file/1F3mORBafaV3PTsD7Zsl4n/Unity-Dev-Job-Task?type=design&node-id=0-1&t=DPe1jnRtu6diFEyW-0)
3. Copy and sign the Test Waiver file found at `Assets/Materials/Test Test Waiver.pdf`
4. Add the signed copy of your test waiver to the `Assets/Signed Waiver/` folder as `[Your Name] - Signed Waiver`
5. Submit a PR titled `[Your Name] Character Customizer` and assign j@jadu.ar as a reviewer.
6. Sit tight! We'll get back to you shortly
